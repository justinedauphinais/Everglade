A 2D Unity Game I am making in my free time so I can learn the basics of making a video game, Unity, and be able to use my art for something productive ! 
It will be a RPG, farming simulator, as the concept of it is simple and it is simple to add more things over the base if I feel like it. It will teach me how to make saves, manage sprites, develop a fighting system, etc.
